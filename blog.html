            <p>So you’ve worked away for years, done the hard yards, and become a respected professional in your field, when someone approaches you and asks you to sit on their nonprofit’s board. So you prepare, research, find out all the correct governance procedures you need to take and become familiar with everything the law requires the company to do.

Some people make guiding a board’s discussion look easy, but now you’re in the perfect position to learn just how tough it can be. So here’s a few quick tips to keep in mind that’ll help make running that room go just a little smoother.

            <p>Minutes are the written record of everything that happens during every meeting that your organisation holds. They’re important for a number of reasons: anyone who couldn’t attend the meeting can read them to catch up; all decisions made during the meetings can be tracked; any future decisions can be cross-referenced with prior discussions to fully inform the decision-makers.

            <p>There’s a simple answer to this question. The most important function of a board of directors is strategic direction; to analyse the recommendations made by the business’s management for furthering that business’s goals. The board will either approve these recommendations or send them back for further development. Frustratingly, many boards don’t do this.

            <p>Forming a governing body is a big step for any startup. It involves careful planning, vetting of potential candidates, and a good amount of trust. Once all that’s done, though, how do you actually put your board in place? Let’s take a look at a few things to think about when establishing your board of directors.

            <p>Creating a startup is a complicated process. Organising investment rounds, product, liaising with customers, it can all be overwhelming and you can be tempted to look for outside help. And you should! Running a startup solo is next to impossible, and a board can be a good way to keep the organisation on track.

Because when it comes down to it, everyboard or committee works a little differently. Some much more differently thanothers. You might find that some of our advice in past articles hasn’t made sensebecause your board doesn’t do things that way. Here’s a quick overview of all thedifferent ways a board can function so you can figure out how best to go aboutyour governance.

            <p>Feeling “burnt out” is something almost everyone has been through at one point or another. Burnout is a serious problem, and has been linked to a number of serious mental health conditions, as well as fatigue, antisocial behaviour, and decreased work performance. Volunteering on a board or committee while also maintaining a career and home life can quickly lead to becoming overworked and burning out. Here’s a few things to think about in your day-to-day that can help hold these problems at bay.

Instead, they can feel like matters of obligation — wearying efforts to tick some bureaucratic boxes and keep management happy. Just think about how many hours are wasted in meetings across the globe on a daily basis, and how that time could be used effectively.

            <p>The Board of Directors is an old tool created by traditional businesses in order to have an oversight for their practices, and to ensure the company is run by the most qualified and experienced workers possible. They therefore typically operate under traditional team structures: 9-5 work days, vertical power structures, strictly rules-oriented. But there is a steadily growing movement to adapt the traditional team into the more free-flowing style of the digital age - widely known as the dynamic team.

If the average person wants to see what’s going on in a particular board meeting, there’s no way to know until some kind of announcement is released. But these are problems that many companies around the world are working to fix, using the wealth of technological advancements available to us.

Every member of the board should be hand-picked to represent the company in all aspects. In any meeting, you might have some on from accounting, HR, sales, or the Tech teams.

            <p>Public speaking is never easy. High school taught us that much, at the least. Giving a presentation takes a lot of prep time and a lot of practice, and if it goes wrong it can feel like a waste - and if it goes catastrophically it can be an embarrassment. Here’s a few quick tips you can use to avoid that dreaded scenario.

            <p>Issues arising from ineffective board papers are one of the biggest sources of conflict between boards and management teams. The management feel like they can’t figure out what the board really wants, while boards get frustrated when they can’t get the information they need. Condensing and clarifying board papers is a key step to remember when writing them, and it’ll go a long way to keeping everybody in your organisation happy. Here are some tips on how to do exactly that.

            <p>Building a committee from the ground up is incredibly daunting. You’ll need to find enough people who know what they’re doing that the organisation will stay afloat; people who properly represent the demographics you serve; people of diverse backgrounds and diverse viewpoints so you can tackle issues from all angles; people who are keen-minded enough to communicate properly with people of different backgrounds. It’s a lot, and as chairperson you’ll need to keep this board in line and on task. Here are three broad steps to think on when building an effective committee.

            <p>So you’ve just been elected as Chair for a small local committee. Maybe you were in another role in the committee for a while and did a great job, or maybe you’re entirely new to committees and have no idea what’s going on (hopefully that didn’t happen, but hey, the world’s a crazy place). What do you do? Are you in charge now? The answers are simple, but there’s some nuance. Let’s get into it.

            <p>In any organisation, there’s someone whose job is to grab everything that falls through the cracks. To keep everyone else on track. For a sports team, it’s the Coach. In a restaurant, it’s the Head Chef. On a board of directors, it’s not the Chair. Not even the Treasurer. While those are important roles, they couldn’t do their jobs without the most key piece to the committee puzzle: the Secretary.

            <p>Not all organisations are the same. Different not-for-profit organisations serve different community needs, therefore their management boards and type of responsibilities they undertake can vary enormously. Essentially though there are certain basic tasks most boards need to undertake if they wish to be successful. There are certain fiduciary duties that all directors must uphold.

            <p>We think the concept of having a ‘dynamic team’ is both interesting and important when running an organisation in the digital age. Last week we published a blog exploring the difference between dynamic and traditional teams. As such, we thought it important to further explore the elements that make up a dynamic team. The first element is that of team building.

            <p>If ever there was a gap between a job’s glamour and its importance, such is the case for the person responsible for board meeting minutes. Meeting minutes serve as a record of what was discussed and decided in a meeting, what actions must be taken, who must take them and when. So, being of such great importance, who is responsible for the minutes?

Like many P&amp;C’s, they have had their fair share of challenges in managing the P&amp;C’s activities, volunteers and in reporting efficiently, concisely and appropriately.

            <p>An association secretary is not to be confused with the office secretarial work. An office secretary is someone who is employed to assist with correspondence, keep records, make appointments and carry out confidential or similar tasks. The word itself was derived from the Latin word “secretaries” which means “confidential officer”. When talking about a association secretary we are referring to the duties like a company secretary which in essence is making sure records are correct for the company.

However, volunteers do not miraculously grow on trees. Some don’t even know they have what it takes until they are properly tapped. Inviting the correct volunteers doesn’t also happen overnight.

            <p>From the discussion on the survey results many people where asking for Volunteer form template that helps gauge how the broad school community can help. A big thank you to Janet from Highland Reserve State School who raised the idea and has shared the form they have used.

            <p>April 2015. After the AGM. I felt blindsided by the work I needed to do, tracking everything down to get prepared for the meeting. I thought my volunteering job was supposed to be easy. Send out an agenda and take minutes at meetings. That’s what I was told. That was my handover. I can help out the school and be involved with staff and parents to improve the outcomes for our children. So why was I up at 11pm tracking down paperwork for the AGM.
