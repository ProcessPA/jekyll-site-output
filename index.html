    cite: "Carol Ramsay – Elanora State High School"

    cite: "Rebecca Long - Boyne Tannum HookUp"
  - testimonial: "I’ve been in the club for over 13 years and it is a lot of work. With Process PA we are saving hours of tedious paperwork and everything is in the one place. Minutes are done quickly and easily, Action Items are assigned and emailed out and in the agenda to follow up in the next meeting. I wish this was available years ago."

Instead of carrying stacks of paper to the meetings, everything has already been distributed and is all contained online and easily accessible for all."

If 'non-techies' like us can use it, anyone can!"
