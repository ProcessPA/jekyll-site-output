</div>
<div class="container" data-cms-content-wrapper="/_layouts/markdown-page.html">
    <p>In this Privacy Policy, ‘us’ ‘we’ or ‘our’ means Process PA Pty Ltd (ABN 45 608 099 832). We are committed to respecting your privacy. Our Privacy Policy sets outs out how we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information.</p>

<p>By providing personal information to us, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any other arrangements that apply between us. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time by publishing changes to it on our website. We encourage you to check our website periodically to ensure that you are aware of our current Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Personal information includes information or an opinion about an individual that is reasonably identifiable. For example, this may include your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details. It may also include financial information.</p>

<p><strong>What personal information do we collect?</strong></p>

<p>We may collect the following types of personal information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name;</li>

  <li>details of the products and services we have provided to you or that you have enquired about, including any additional information necessary to deliver those products and services and respond to your enquiries;</li>
  <li>any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our website or app or indirectly through your use of our website or app or online presence or through other websites or accounts from which you permit us to collect information;</li>
  <li>information you provide to us through customer surveys; or</li>
  <li>any other personal information that may be required in order to facilitate your dealings with us.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, when you apply for a job or position with us we may collect certain information from you (including your name, contact details, working history and relevant records checks) from any recruitment consultant, your previous employers and others who may be able to provide information to us to assist in our decision on whether or not to make you an offer of employment or engage you under a contract. This Privacy Policy does not apply to acts and practices in relation to employee records of our current and former employees, which are exempt from the Privacy Act.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we collect, use and disclose personal information?</strong></p>

<p>We may collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to enable you to access and use our website and applications;</li>

  <li>to send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and information requested by you;</li>
  <li>to send you marketing and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you, including information sent by, or on behalf of, our business partners that we think you may find interesting;</li>
  <li>to administer rewards, surveys, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners;</li>
  <li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our users, and enforce our agreements with third parties; and</li>
  <li>to consider your employment application.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also disclose your personal information to a trusted third party who also holds other information about you. This third party may combine that information in order to enable it and us to develop anonymised consumer insights so that we can better understand your preferences and interests, personalise your experience and enhance the products and services that you receive.</p>

<p><strong>Do we use your personal information for direct marketing?</strong></p>

<p>We and/or our carefully selected business partners may send you direct marketing communications and information about our products. This may take the form of emails, SMS, mail or other forms of communication, in accordance with the Spam Act and the Privacy Act.

<p><strong>Disclosure of personal information outside Australia</strong></p>

<p>We may disclose personal information outside of Australia to cloud providers located in United States. Data is stored in Australia but may be accessed externally for support purposes.</p>

<p>When you provide your personal information to us, you consent to the disclosure of your information outside of Australia and acknowledge that we are not required to ensure that overseas recipients handle that personal information in compliance with Australian Privacy Law. We will, however, take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient will deal with such personal information in a way that is consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

<p><strong>Using our website and cookies</strong></p>

<p>We may collect personal information about you when you use and access our website.</p>

<p>While we do not use browsing information to identify you personally, we may record certain information about your use of our website, such as which pages you visit, the time and date of your visit and the internet protocol address assigned to your computer.</p>

<p>We may also use ‘cookies’ or other similar tracking technologies on our website that help us track your website usage and remember your preferences. Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognise you across different websites, services, devices and/or browsing sessions. You can disable cookies through your internet browser but our websites may not work as intended for you if you do so.</p>

<p>We may also use cookies to enable us to collect data that may include personal information. For example, where a cookie is linked to your account, it will be considered personal information under the Privacy Act. We will handle any personal information collected by cookies in the same way that we handle all other personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>We may hold your personal information in either electronic or hard copy form. We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information. For example, we use encryption, auditing and automated software tests. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Links</strong></p>

<p>Our website may contain links to websites operated by third parties. Those links are provided for convenience and may not remain current or be maintained. Unless expressly stated otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of, or any content on, those linked websites, and have no control over or rights in those linked websites. The privacy policies that apply to those other websites may differ substantially from our Privacy Policy, so we encourage individuals to read them before using those websites.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing or correcting your personal information</strong></p>

<p>You can access the personal information we hold about you by contacting us at support@processpa.com. Sometimes, we may not be able to provide you with access to all of your personal information and, where this is the case, we will tell you why. We may also need to verify your identity when you request your personal information.</p>

<p>If you think that any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, please contact us and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is corrected.</p>

Please include your name, email address and/or telephone number and clearly describe your complaint. We will acknowledge your complaint and respond to you regarding your complaint within a reasonable period of time.
