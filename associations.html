            <p class="lead">For people on committees running associations or boards, the administration is often done by people who put their hand up but without training. There are many resources available that give guidance on what needs to be done, but that takes more time than people have to volunteer. Process PA provides a tool that guides the committee member through the role requirements and automatically performs many of the repetitive tasks.</p>
